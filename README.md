# Statshammer

Software for checking matchups in Warhammer 40k.  Based on the wonderful idea of [MathHammer](https://www.mathhammer8thed.com/), but adding visualization of the statistical distributions of the results.

This app uses monte carlo simulations to run the attack thousands of times to develop a distribution so you can tell how effective a set of attacks are on a particular type of defender.
